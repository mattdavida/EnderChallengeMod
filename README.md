## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### NG+ Save State Limitation
**CRITICAL:** Once you save your game while NG+ is enabled, the difficulty becomes permanently locked to NG+ mode for that save file.

**Safe Usage Pattern:**
1. Toggle NG+ on ‚Üí Enter area ‚Üí Experience tough enemies
2. Leave area ‚Üí Toggle NG+ off ‚Üí Re-enter area ‚Üí Normal difficulty ‚úÖ

**Problematic Pattern:**
1. Toggle NG+ on ‚Üí **Save game** ‚Üí Enemies become permanently tough
2. Toggle NG+ off ‚Üí Re-enter areas ‚Üí Enemies still tough ‚ùå
3. Once you enable boss rush - you can save but quitting to title will cause game to crash. This is a known limitation. I recommend quitting and reopening the game to load new saves. 

**Recommendation:** Test NG+ mode without saving first. Only save when you're committed to NG+ difficulty for that playthrough.

## üéØ Recommended Usage

**For Challenge Runs:**
- Combine with StatMod's level restrictions for ultimate difficulty
- Use NG+ toggle to create scaling difficulty spikes
- Practice boss sequences before attempting full runs

**For Testing:**
- Validate build effectiveness against NG+ scaling
- Test boss encounter strategies in isolation
- Verify equipment performance at endgame difficulty
